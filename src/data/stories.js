I prepared well, was very optimisitic about my chances and yet - scored half of what I had been consistently scoring in practice tests. Despite all the demotivation, I prepared again in the remaining 2 months for another test and I have to thank my parents for their suppoort - I cracked that test and today study in one of the most prestigious engineering colleges in India in the best possible branch. Even in college, I have tried and failed. I tried for multiple hackathons and case challenges etc only to reach the final or pre-final round and lose. Always. I tried asking for referrals, even got to interview at a few companies like Amazon, Goldman Sachs - only to be rejected. But finally I got an offer from JPMC for a QR internship and I cannot be happier. It is not a role I had envisioned myself in, but maybe this role will lead me to a brighter future.
